# Games Workshop-Inspired Store Page

This project is a tribute to one of my favorite websites — the **Games Workshop store page**. My goal was to replicate its style and structure while exploring web development techniques and design practices using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap**.

## 🌟 Features

### 🏠 Home Page  
The main landing page features a blend of:
- Product previews
- Informational banners
- Custom content cards

### 🎨 Dynamic Visual Elements  
With the power of **CSS**, I added interactive features like:
- Responsive resizing
- Color transitions
- Custom fonts and style changes for a more immersive experience

### 🛡️ Product Line Sections  
I included dedicated sections for:
- **Warhammer 40,000**
- **Age of Sigmar**

These sections showcase the distinct aesthetics and themes of each line.

### 🧱 Product Display Framework  
I built a framework to showcase individual products, using examples like:
- A **Dwarf** (Age of Sigmar)
- A **Space Marine** (Warhammer 40K)

While these are static examples, the layout was designed with scalability in mind. Full product management would involve **JavaScript** and backend integration.

### 🧩 UI Components  
The site includes a wide range of UI elements, such as:
- Cards
- Carousels
- Hero banners
- Tables
- Accordions  
… and more, all styled to match the Games Workshop theme.

### 🔧 Customization  
- Custom **footer**
- Unique **font choices**  
These details give the site a personalized look and feel.

## 💡 What I Learned  
This project was both challenging and rewarding. It deepened my understanding of:
- Combining **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap**
- Creating visually appealing layouts
- Structuring components for scalability and future development
