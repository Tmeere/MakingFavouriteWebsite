For this website, I aimed to replicate my favorite site, the Games Workshop store page.

The website includes several key elements:

- Home Page: This features product items, informational banners, and cards with various content.
- Dynamic Elements: I used CSS to add dynamic features, allowing changes in size, color, and font.
- Sections for Specific Product Lines: Two additional sections were added to showcase the 40,000 and Age of Sigmar product lines, highlighting their differences.
- Product Framework: I created a framework to display individual products, including examples like a Dwarf and a Space Marine. These were used to illustrate how products would appear, with the understanding that product management on a larger scale would be handled with JavaScript and backend methods.
- Custom Footer and Fonts: The website also features a custom footer and fonts to personalize the look and feel.
- Although this project presented significant challenges, Iâ€™m very pleased with the result. It helped me gain a deeper understanding of working with Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS together.

The website also includes various components such as cards, carousels, tables, hero banners, accordions, and more.
